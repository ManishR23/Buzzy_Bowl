Buzzy_Bowl UAV Simulation with PID Control and Collision Detection

This project simulates a fleet of UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) on the Buzzy_Bowl football field, using PID control to navigate and maintain their positions within the designated flight paths. The UAVs' movement and interaction are governed by PID controllers for both position and velocity, ensuring smooth and stable flight across the field. The simulation also integrates collision detection for UAVs to interact with each other in a dynamic environment.
